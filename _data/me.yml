    Machine on a Mission is a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqA-bpFdLWzugMIeK26UjnQ'>Machine Girl</a> 
    lyric from the song <a href='https://youtu.be/Il_51tSLadg?t=124'>Mchngrl vs Wlfgrl</a> that I feel
    represents who I am (a programmer who approaches problem solving in a very machine-like way) and what I do (single-minded focus on projects that improve people's lives).

    Designed by a friend of mine in my college's graphic design class, the logo 
    combines 3 elements: the <code>&lt;tagname&gt;</code> style tags used in 
    HTML, the letter 𝑥 as used in algebra, and an infinity symbol.

    All of my projects follow a common theme: they solve problems that I have. I have a problem in my life or something
    I wish existed, so I make it myself and release it for free.
